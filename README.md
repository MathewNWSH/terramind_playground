## Features
<!-- Embeddings have 16x16 patches so we shoud consider usecases that works on this scale 16x16px is 160x160m of Sentinel-2 -->
<!-- I think we should focuse more on problem that we wan to solve rather than preparing technical solution, so if we come up with something worthwhile, we will work it out technically.-->
<!-- The example of deforestation we discussed is quite good, but let's think about it. -->
<!-- We can look what community already figured out here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/ibm-esa-geospatial/challenge/discussions -->
<!-- I propose: Lets test on small example, one S-2 Sentinel-2 image using terratorch library and look how embeddings dimension, computation time, and decide what we can do with that -->


- Determine the technical requirements for the embedding.
- Develop the chip's generator (python code) to on demande production of proper embeddings.
- Vectorize the deforestation data and find intersecting datasets related to this phenomenon.
- Find similar patterns in time and space. (The work on terramind itself?)
